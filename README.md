## Description

zdim is a basic Python program used for calculating the induced dipole interaction for a molecule-nanoparticle system. 

ZDIM is a basic Python programme used for calculating the complex frequency-dependent field-induced dipole moment of a chemical system, as well as other electric properties. The `zdim.py` file is the main file, which utilises the costum functions of the `zdimpy` package.

**Notice**: The programme is sill being developed and is therefore subject to frequent changes. Differences in the code presented here and that used to achieve the results presented in "Electric response properties of silver clusters" may exist.
