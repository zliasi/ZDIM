## Description
zdim is a basic Python program used for calculating the induced dipole interaction for a molecule-nanoparticle system. 

**Notice**: This program is under development and the usable versions of the program are therefore frequently subject to changes, both big and small. Though stable, the different versions might contain bugs and/or mistakes. 

## Usage
In order to aquire and use the program, download the `zdim-source.tar` file to the desired local location.

```
$ wget https://github.com/zliasi/zdim/blob/master/zdim-source.tar.xz
```

After downloading the `.tar` file, extract it and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file.

## Versions

* **Version 1**: First iteration of the program. This version isn't suitable for use (contains a multitude of problems).

* **Version 2**: The computations are done using isotropic polarizability and dipole interaction tensors.

* **Version 3**: The computations are done using non-isotropic polarizability tensors and dipole interaction tensors.

* **Version 4**: ...
